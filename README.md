# Slack Connect for Jenkins-CI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peergum/slack-connect-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peergum/slack-connect-plugin)

###Preamble
This plugin was forked from the original Slack plugin, itself a fork of the [HipChat plugin](https://github.com/jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin),
which was, in turn, a fork of the Campfire plugin. The latest fork was due to divergences of views about the way new features and changes were
implemented into the plugin without any consensus from the user base, potentially breaking compatibility and causing issues for some,
myself and my company included. This particular repository will implement mostly corrective patches and improvements, any new feature or change
impacting notifications from the plugin being voted first, requiring at least 50% of agreement from the participants.
