The latest fork was due to divergences of views about the way new features and changes were\r\nimplemented into the plugin without any consensus from the user base, potentially breaking compatibility and causing issues for some,\r\nmyself and my company included. This particular repository will implement mostly corrective patches and improvements, any new feature or change\r\nimpacting notifications from the plugin being voted first, requiring at least 50% of agreement from the participants.\r\n\r\n# Jenkins Instructions\r\n\r\nsee [wiki](//github.com/peergum/slack-connect-plugin/wiki/User-Documentation)\r\n\r\n# Developer instructions\r\n\r\nsee [wiki](//github.com/peergum/slack-connect-plugin/wiki/Developer-Documentation)\r\n","google":"UA-61095211-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
